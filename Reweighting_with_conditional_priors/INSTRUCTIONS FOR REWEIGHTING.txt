The Raw Table containting the Tabulated Priors are in /THEORY/USERS/swetha.bhagwat/Conditional_Prior_reweighting/Tabulated_Conditional_Priors/ on Vera. 

#1take the numerical prior and write it into the cvs format. 
Run format_to_cvs.py converts the csv file of look up table 

#2Read the sample of m1,m2,a1,a2 from the posterior distibution: Input postrerior distibution, output the list of m1,m2,a1,a2 (../Conditional_Prior_reweighting/gw170818/LIGO_prior/LIGOprior_gw170818_sample_point.csv)
THEORY/swetha.bhagwat/Conditional_Prior_reweighting/

LIGOprior_gw170818_sample_point.csv then remove the # in front of the mass1, mass2, a1,a2

#3Next run generate_weights.py that generates the weights corresponding to the samples in the 
LIGOprior_gw170818_sample_point.csv and looks up file in 1. 

#Then open an ipython notebook by 
jupyter notebook --port 9000 --no-browse on Vera along with ssh -N -f -L localhost:9000:localhost:9000 swetha.bhagwat@vera.roma1.infn.it
 on your computer terminal.
